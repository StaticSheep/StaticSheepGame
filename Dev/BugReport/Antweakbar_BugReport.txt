[Crash Bugs]

  FIXED Adding gamepad component immediately breaks.
  
  DEAL WITH IT Camera component breaks everything.
  
  DEAL WITH IT Loading a space named NewSpace0, then creating a new space = crash.
  
  CANT REPLICATE If a box collider is removed from an object, then the object is deleted that engine crashes.

[Unhandled Bugs]

  FIXED SoundEmitter continues playing after space is destroyed. (Sound emitter shouldn't be playing music anyway though...)
  
  FIXED Object's names in the object list of space is not updated until after loading an archetype

  FIXED? Cannot tell which GUID belongs to which object. (Not updating the space when something is renamed)
  
  FIXED Archetype transforms are saved, should be set to (0, 0, 0)
    
  FIXED When saving a level, it will no matter what append .level to the end...
    i.e. If user types in HUD.level, it'll save it as HUD.level.level
    
  When a space is saved, the serializer adds a few extra new lines before boxcollider???
  
[General To-Dos]

  Set the physics time step to 0 when the editor is up.
  
  Seperate the editor from actually playing the game.
  
  Can we have a button to open up a Lua script from the editor?
